### A collection of coding creations by Kent Gray.

I love creating solutions to problems whether it is personal or technical. Learning and coding are a lot like competing in tennis tournaments, its a long term commitment but the satisfaction comes with each successful application. Learn more about my professional experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kentmgray). I also have a [blog](http://kentgray.me/) about my experience in the development community.
