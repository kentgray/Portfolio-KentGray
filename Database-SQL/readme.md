### Database and SQL Course Work
***

This is a collection of my dataase and SQL course work at The Tech Academy, both step-by-step drill work and assignments my own solutions.

If you would like to see only my own solutions to software challenges, please check out my [portfolio](https://github.com/kentgray/Portfolio-KentGray) of my work with readme files detailing how I solved each one.
