### Ruby Course Work
***

This is a collection of my Ruby course work that I studied on my own.  These are sample applications that were built from what I've studied.

If you would like to see only my own solutions to software challenges, please check out my [portfolio](https://github.com/kentgray/Portfolio-KentGray) of my work with readme files detailing how I solved each one.
